#BlackJack game using jQuery, HTML and CSS

##The JavaScript has three primary buttons, deal, hit and Stand. All three run the placeCard() function, and the calculateTotal function. shuffleDeck is exclusive to Deal and checkWin is exclusive to stand.

###Setup the table using Bootstrap. 

Create a dealers hand and players hand to hold the totals.

Set each card to a custom width (adjust col-sm-2 to 11% to avoid having to write 3 extra divs).

Add 3 buttons to the bottom of the table so the user can interact with the game.

###Write some JavaScript!

Bind each button to a jQuery click function and call the correct function depending on the click.

- bind a functiod called deal to the deal button.

- When called, it will create a deck in default order, then swap two cards in the array 500 times.

- Once all the swaps are done, the deck will be shuffled. The number can be changed from 500 for varying degrees of "shuffleness."

- After the deck is shuffled, the playerHand and DealerHand arrays are created with the 0,2 and 1,3 cards in theDeck array (shuffled deck).

- The placeCard function is then called which takes 3 parameters: the playersHand array, who's turn it is, and the slot the card goes into.

- placeCard then removes the "empty" class to accomdate stlying, and updates the HTML to use the card value.

- calculateTotal function is then called which is sent two parameters: the playerHand array and who's turn it is. It slices each card in the array via a loop and removes the letter on the end. The result is turned into a Number to ensure we can run math functions on it and then the total is updated with the new number
